    <h2>Title 18 Statutes with a Focus on Civil Rights</h2>
    <h3> *not every statute is covered, as there are many hundreds of provisions under this title. This particular set of statutes come from the FBI's website found <a href ="https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/civil-rights/federal-civil-rights-statutes">here.</a></h3>
    <ul>Title 18, U.S.C., Section 249 <ul>Hate Crime Protection: this statute essentially lays out the consequences of committing a crime upon another intentionally because of their skin color, religion, ethnicity, gender, disability status, etc. There are processes in place to fund a thorough investigation into if a crime falls into this category. Maximum sentence is 10 years unless the hate crime was committed in conjunction with kidnapping or aggravated sexual assault and/or abuse, in which case the sentence will be extended.</ul> </ul>
    <ul>Title 18, U.S.C., Section 248 <ul>This statute prohibits obstructing, blocking, or in any way making access to a clinic for reproductive health difficult. In addition to physical force, this statute prohibits the use of intimidation or verbal threat of force to any person wishing to enter the clinic. This includes getting services like an abortion, medication (birth control pills, emergency contraception, etc.) Furthermore, harm to the building itself is prohibited and each of the aforementioned offenses can result in fines or jail time depending on the severity of the disruption. </ul></ul>
    <ul>Title 18, U.S.C., Section 241 <ul>Any group of two or more is prohibited from planning to injure or harm another or otherwise "conspire against their rights". The punishment for this crime includes fines and jail time, and similarly to Section 249, consequences will be greater in conjunction with kidnapping or sexual assault.</ul></ul>
    <ul>Title 18, U.S.C., Section 14141 <ul>This section prohibits acts by law enforcement such as using excessive force, acting in a discriminatory manner, making a false arrest, inappropriate sexual conduct, etc. This is in reference to an officer of laws actions when dealing with juveniles. This is designed to protect minor's rights by ensuring fair treatment from law enforcement.</ul>
    
   
    <h2>The Importance of Title 18: Who does it protect?</h2>
    <ul>This title and its contents protect everyone in our country--from children, the elderly, minorities, women, and even endangered animals. It covers many aspects of crimes and criminal procedures pertinent to every situation and is constantly being ammended to include more groups and provide protection in the toughest of circumstances. </ul>
