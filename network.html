It looks at the destination address that accompanies each message across the connection only when that message is destined for a computer on the other side. </ul> <ul>3. a bridge with multiple connections, allowing it to connect several buses rather than just two. So, a switch produces a network consisting of several buses extending from the switch, as spokes on a wheel. </ul> <ul>4. the connection between networks to form an internet; special purpose computers used for forwarding messages. </ul> <ul>5. the point at which one network is linked to an internet; it serves as a passageway between the network and the outside world. </ul>  </td>
